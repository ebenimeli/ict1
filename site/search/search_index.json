Aliases and avatars. Introduction The internet is an important part of our lives, and it is becoming increasingly common for people to share personal information and interact with others online. However, it's essential to be aware of the impact of our digital identity and how it can affect our lives. One aspect of digital identity that is often overlooked is the use of aliases and avatars. This content aims to explain what aliases and avatars are, their benefits and potential risks, and how to use them safely. What are aliases and avatars? Aliases are fictitious names that individuals use to represent themselves online. They are often used to protect real identity or create a new identity for online purposes. Avatars are digital representations of a person or a character, often used in online gaming, social media, or forums. Benefits of aliases and avatars: They provide anonymity, which can be beneficial for those who want to express themselves freely without fear of being identified. They can be useful for individuals who want to separate their personal and professional lives or have different online personas for various interests. Avatars can be a fun way to represent oneself and explore different identities without any real-life consequences. Potential risks of aliases and avatars: Using aliases and avatars can make it easier for individuals to engage in cyberbullying or other harmful online behaviors. Creating fake identities can be a form of deception, which can harm the trust between online communities. Over-reliance on aliases and avatars can cause individuals to detach themselves from their real-life identity, which can lead to social and emotional difficulties. How to use aliases and avatars safely: Avoid using aliases to engage in harmful or deceptive behavior. Be mindful of the information you share online, even if you're using an alias or an avatar. Choose an avatar that doesn't resemble a real person, especially if you're playing online games or joining virtual communities. Don't let aliases and avatars replace your real-life identity or relationships. Conclusion Personal identity on the internet is an important topic to understand, and aliases and avatars are just one aspect of it. While they can be beneficial, it's crucial to be aware of their potential risks and use them responsibly. By being mindful of our digital identity and taking steps to protect it, we can enjoy the benefits of the internet without compromising our safety or privacy.", "title": "Creating Online Personas: Choosing Usernames and Avatars"}, {"location": "contents/digitalid/aliasavatar.html#creating-online-personas-choosing-usernames-and-avatars", "text": "Personal identity on the Internet.

Digital identity refers to the information that we share or that is available about us on the internet or in digital spaces. This includes personal information such as our name, age, address, and other details that we might share online. It also includes the things we post or share online, including photos, videos, comments, and opinions. Positive and negative impacts Digital identity can have both positive and negative impacts on our lives. It can help us to connect with others, express ourselves, and share our interests and passions. However, it can also put us at risk of cyberbullying, identity theft, and other online dangers. It's important to be aware of our digital identity and take steps to protect it. This includes being careful about what we share online, using strong passwords and security settings, and being mindful of our online behavior and interactions with others. Video: What is Digital Identity? Video transcription What is digital identity? A digital identity is the compilation of information about you that exists online. Your digital identity includes anything online that is associated with your name, such as social media posts, interactions, articles, publications, institutional affiliations, and more. Our digital identities are created by how we present ourselves, and how we are seen by others, in both personal and professional settings. But why is understanding digital identity important? Who we are online gives others insight into who we are in real life. This leads us to make assumptions about people even if we have never met them in person. How do we create a digital identity? Step 1: Google Yourself The first step to creating your digital identity is to realize that if you engage online you likely already have one. Take inventory of how you appear online by Googling yourself, or looking at past social media posts and interactions. [A graphic of a search engine appears with the words \u201cWho am I?\u201d typed into the search bar.] Ask yourself: Does this digital image represent who I am right now? Are these profiles active, and do I want to change them? Why do I want to use this social account, and What are my goals for my digital identity? Step 2: Set goals The next step to creating your digital identity is to understand your goals. Do you want your digital identity to represent your professional aspirations, or your personal and social aims? Someone marketing themselves as an academic or business professional may have different goals and a different digital identity than a comedian, an artist, or a teacher. Do all your social accounts align with the same goal and persona? What are future employers seeing when they google your name? Think about whether your online presence is hindering any personal or professional aims. Decide on a goal and stay consistent across your platforms. Step 3: Be authentic Your digital identity should ultimately reflect who you are offline, whether this is your personal or professional life. Being authentic will help you maintain a consistent image across platforms. [An animated man appears on screen holding his phone. Beside him is an enlarged phone screen containing his social media profiles. He appears the same in both.] Are digital identities always authentic? While authenticity is important, what we see online does not always reflect how a person is in the real world. Keep in mind that a digital identity is a curated image of a person that does not always reflect their whole self. The online world can even contain false identities that differ drastically from who the people behind them really are. [The woman's social media account is displayed on screen. An X appears to show that her identity is false and an arrow points to a different figure that represents her true identity.] Our digital identity can affect the interactions, opportunities, and reputation we have in the real world. When creating your digital identity, it is important to take inventory of your online past, define your goals, and present yourself authentically across all platforms.

Who we are online gives others insight into who we are in real life. This leads us to make assumptions about people even if we have never met them in person. How do we create a digital identity? Step 1: Google Yourself The first step to creating your digital identity is to realize that if you engage online you likely already have one. Take inventory of how you appear online by Googling yourself, or looking at past social media posts and interactions. [A graphic of a search engine appears with the words \u201cWho am I?\u201d typed into the search bar.] Ask yourself: Does this digital image represent who I am right now? Are these profiles active, and do I want to change them? Why do I want to use this social account, and What are my goals for my digital identity? Step 2: Set goals The next step to creating your digital identity is to understand your goals. Do you want your digital identity to represent your professional aspirations, or your personal and social aims? Someone marketing themselves as an academic or business professional may have different goals and a different digital identity than a comedian, an artist, or a teacher. Do all your social accounts align with the same goal and persona? What are future employers seeing when they google your name? Think about whether your online presence is hindering any personal or professional aims. Decide on a goal and stay consistent across your platforms. Step 3: Be authentic Your digital identity should ultimately reflect who you are offline, whether this is your personal or professional life. Being authentic will help you maintain a consistent image across platforms. [An animated man appears on screen holding his phone. Beside him is an enlarged phone screen containing his social media profiles. He appears the same in both.] Are digital identities always authentic? While authenticity is important, what we see online does not always reflect how a person is in the real world. Keep in mind that a digital identity is a curated image of a person that does not always reflect their whole self. The online world can even contain false identities that differ drastically from who the people behind them really are. [The woman's social media account is displayed on screen. An X appears to show that her identity is false and an arrow points to a different figure that represents her true identity.] Our digital identity can affect the interactions, opportunities, and reputation we have in the real world. When creating your digital identity, it is important to take inventory of your online past, define your goals, and present yourself authentically across all platforms.", "title": "Video transcription"}, {"location": "contents/digitalid/digitalid.html#glossary-with-examples", "text": "English Spanish Example sentence Address Direcci\u00f3n Make sure to keep your address private when sharing information online.

Fake News Fake news refers to false or misleading information presented as news, often with the intent to deceive. The rise of fake news has been facilitated by the ease with which information can be shared online. Fake news can spread rapidly, reaching large audiences quickly and influencing public opinion. The consequences of fake news are far-reaching; it can sway elections, damage reputations, and even incite violence.

Hate Speech Hate speech , defined as any communication that belittles a person or a group based on characteristics such as race, religion, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation, poses another serious threat to social harmony. The anonymity provided by the internet often emboldens individuals to express hateful views they might not otherwise share publicly. Hate speech can lead to real-world violence, discrimination, and the marginalization of vulnerable communities.

We're here to teach you a few things you need to know so you can stay safe online and enjoy all of the fun things that the web has to offer. Protect your stuff! Most of us have things on the web that we want to keep safe. One of the best ways to keep those things safe is to make sure that you set strong passwords on all your accounts. By knowing how to create strong passwords, you can further safeguard your personal information. So how do you create a really strong password? First, use at least eight characters. The longer your password is, the harder it is to guess. Second, mix letters, numbers, and symbols. And third, make it different for each site. Once we know how to set a strong password, we need to learn how to remember that strong password. At Google, we recommend you pick a favorite book title, sports team, song, or phrase to help you build a strong password. Don't share your password unless it's with a parent or trusted adult. Like the key to your house or the combination to your locker, passwords protect things that are of value to you and shouldn't be shared. Protecting your information online also means logging out of websites, programs, and applications that are used on public or shared computers when you're done with them. If you don't log out of public computers, someone could log in as you and access your accounts and information. So always remember to protect your stuff.

But a big part of online safety involves simple, smart practices like selecting good passwords. You can think of your password like the code to a vault where you keep your most valuable documents and information. Make sure your password is strong and don't share it with others. To create a strong password, use a mix of lower and upper case letters, numbers, and symbols, and make it between eight and nine characters long. Avoid using any identifiable information such as your name, address, phone number, or personal information that is easy to guess, like your pet's name, the name of your school, your favorite team, etc. Choose a different password for each of your important accounts, like your email, social network, and online banking accounts. Reusing passwords is risky. If someone figures out the password for one of your accounts, it's possible they could get access to your personal information or other online services that you use. But how can you create a different password for each account that meets all this criteria and that's easy to remember? The answer is simple. You can create a passphrase. To create a passphrase, first think of a sentence that's easy for you to remember. For example, \"I met Alice in San Francisco in 2011.\" Now, take the first letter of each word in the sentence and use it to create your passphrase. Where possible, convert words into symbols to make your passphrase stronger. There you have it. You can add an extra layer of security by enabling two-factor authentication, the security process where logging into a service requires two steps. For instance, you could have to enter your password as usual, followed by a code that was texted to your phone. Two-factor authentication protects your account with something that you know, your password, and something that you have, your cell phone. This means that if someone steals or guesses your password, they still can't sign into your account because they don't have your phone. Now you know how to sign in safely into your account. But it's equally important to know when to log out. If you're using a public or shared computer, such as a computer at a library, internet cafe, or even a friend's house, sign out of your account before leaving the computer. Otherwise, the person who uses the computer after you may have access to your account. Great. Now let's talk about privacy and security settings. Forgetting your password or getting locked out of your account can be a frustrating experience. No one wants to lose access to their emails, documents, or photos. To make sure you can get back into your account quickly and easily, it's important to set up password recovery options. Most online services will give you the option of adding a recovery phone number or email address to your account. This way, you can receive a numeric code or link to reset your password and regain access to your account. It's important to set up your recovery options before this happens. Take some time to explore other privacy and security settings on the online services that you use. Change your password if you suspect unusual activity in your account. And become familiar with the privacy policy, which will tell you what information about you is collected and stored and for what purposes. When using social networks, make sure to review the privacy and security settings to decide what information is visible in your profile, who can view your posts, photos, videos, or other content that you share.

Smart Devices for Home and School 1.1. Personal computers, mobile devices, and other devices for domestic and educational use In today's world, digital devices play a crucial role in both our daily lives and educational environments. Let's explore the various types of devices, their uses, and how they contribute to our learning and daily activities. Personal Computers Personal computers (PCs) are perhaps the most versatile and powerful digital devices we use. They come in two main forms: desktops and laptops. Desktops : These are larger, stationary computers often used in homes and offices. Desktops have separate components, including a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and the central processing unit (CPU). They are powerful and can handle complex tasks such as video editing, gaming, and running multiple applications simultaneously. Laptops : These are portable computers that combine all the desktop components into one compact device. Laptops are widely used by students and professionals because of their portability. They are suitable for a range of activities, from writing essays and browsing the internet to creating presentations and coding. Mobile Devices Mobile devices include smartphones and tablets, which are essential for on-the-go connectivity and convenience. Smartphones : These are handheld devices that combine the functionalities of a phone and a computer. Smartphones are incredibly versatile, allowing users to make calls, send messages, browse the internet, take photos, and use a wide variety of applications (apps). For students, smartphones can be useful for quick research, educational apps, and staying organized with calendars and reminders. Tablets : Tablets are larger than smartphones but smaller than laptops. They offer a balance between portability and functionality. Tablets are ideal for reading e-books, watching educational videos, drawing, and taking notes. They often come with touchscreens and can be paired with accessories like styluses and keyboards to enhance their usability. Other Devices for Domestic and Educational Use Apart from PCs and mobile devices, there are other digital tools that are commonly used at home and in educational settings. E-Readers : These devices are specifically designed for reading digital books. They have screens that are easy on the eyes and can store thousands of books, making them convenient for avid readers and students who need access to numerous textbooks. Smart Speakers : Devices like Amazon Echo and Google Home can assist with a variety of tasks through voice commands. They can set reminders, answer questions, play music, and control other smart home devices. In educational contexts, they can help students with quick facts and language learning. Wearables : Smartwatches and fitness trackers are examples of wearables. They can monitor health metrics, send notifications, and even support some educational apps. For students, they can be useful for time management and staying active. Interactive Whiteboards : These are large, touch-sensitive screens used in classrooms to enhance teaching and learning. They allow teachers to display information dynamically and interactively, making lessons more engaging. Importance in Education Digital devices have transformed education by providing access to vast resources and enabling interactive learning. They support various learning styles, facilitate collaboration, and offer personalized learning experiences. For example, students can use laptops to conduct research, participate in virtual classrooms using tablets, and use smartphones to stay connected with their peers and teachers.

Computer science is the study of computers and how they work. It helps us understand how computers are built (hardware) and how we make them do specific tasks (software). Computer science also looks at how computers can connect with each other through networks and the Internet. This connection lets computers share information all around the world. We use computers to help us in many ways. For example, computers can play games, help us write stories, or find information online. Computer science teaches us how to make computers useful tools in our daily lives, whether at school, at home, or even in jobs someday. How We Use Computers When we use a computer, there are three main steps. These steps help the computer turn our data, or information, into something useful for us. Data Input : First, we need to give information, or data, to the computer. This step is called input. We might type words on a keyboard or use other devices to add data. For example, if we want to add a picture to the computer, we can use a scanner to scan the image or a digital camera to take a photo. These tools help put our data into the computer. Data Processing : After we add data, the computer works with it. This is called processing. Processing means the computer saves, organizes, and changes the data to make it useful. For example, if we give the computer numbers, it can add them together. Or, if we add pictures, the computer might make them brighter or larger. Processing helps the computer understand our data and turn it into information we can use. Output Information : After processing, the computer shows us the result, or output. Output is the information that we see after the computer has worked with our data. We might see the output on a screen, hear it as sound, or even print it on paper. For example, the computer might show us a photo we edited or a score from a game. Output is the final product that helps us use our data in a new way.

It performs calculations and carries out instructions to make the device work. Without the CPU, your computer, tablet, or smartphone wouldn't be able to do anything useful. Let's delve deeper into what makes the CPU so crucial and how it operates. Key points Brain of the Device: The CPU processes instructions from programs and applications. Just like our brains control our actions, the CPU controls the functions of a digital device. Every action you take on a device, whether it\u2019s opening an app, playing a game, or typing a document, is processed by the CPU. It translates human actions (like clicking a mouse) into actions the device can perform. Speed: CPU speed is measured in gigahertz (GHz). A higher number means a faster CPU. For example, a 3.5 GHz CPU can perform 3.5 billion cycles per second. These cycles are like tiny steps in processing information. The more cycles per second, the more instructions the CPU can handle, leading to faster performance. This speed impacts how quickly your device can open programs, run applications, and execute commands. Cores: Modern CPUs have multiple cores. More cores allow a device to perform multiple tasks at the same time. Initially, CPUs had a single core, meaning they could handle one task at a time. However, most modern CPUs are multicore, with dual-core, quad-core, and even octa-core processors being common. Each core can handle its own tasks, making multitasking smoother and more efficient. For instance, while one core handles a game you\u2019re playing, another core can manage background tasks like checking for email updates. How the CPU Works To understand the CPU better, let's break down its main functions: Fetch: The CPU gets the next instruction from the device's RAM (Random Access Memory). Decode: It then decodes the instruction to understand what action is needed. Execute: The CPU performs the instruction, whether it\u2019s a calculation, data transfer, or something else. Store: Finally, the CPU writes the result back to the RAM or a register (a small storage location within the CPU). Real-World Analogy Think of the CPU like a teacher in a classroom. The teacher gives instructions to students (the device's other parts) to complete tasks. A faster teacher (higher GHz) and more teachers (more cores) mean tasks are done quicker and more efficiently. If the teacher can instruct faster, students complete their work faster. If there are multiple teachers, more students can receive instructions simultaneously, improving overall efficiency. Importance of CPU in Everyday Use: In your daily use of digital devices, the CPU plays a critical role. When you launch a web browser, the CPU fetches, decodes, and executes the necessary instructions to display the web page. When you play a game, the CPU handles complex calculations to render graphics, process game logic, and respond to your inputs. Even simple tasks like typing a document or watching a video rely on the CPU to function smoothly. A powerful CPU can significantly enhance your experience by reducing lag, improving load times, and allowing for more complex applications to run seamlessly. As technology advances, CPUs continue to evolve, becoming more powerful and efficient, which in turn makes our devices more capable and responsive. Understanding the CPU's role helps you appreciate why certain devices perform better than others and why upgrading your CPU can lead to noticeable improvements in performance.", "title": "Central Processing Unit (CPU)"}, {"location": "contents/unit01/s12_cpu.html#central-processing-unit-cpu", "text": "The Central Processing Unit, or CPU, is often called the brain of a digital device.

It translates human actions (like clicking a mouse) into actions the device can perform. Speed: CPU speed is measured in gigahertz (GHz). A higher number means a faster CPU. For example, a 3.5 GHz CPU can perform 3.5 billion cycles per second. These cycles are like tiny steps in processing information. The more cycles per second, the more instructions the CPU can handle, leading to faster performance. This speed impacts how quickly your device can open programs, run applications, and execute commands. Cores: Modern CPUs have multiple cores. More cores allow a device to perform multiple tasks at the same time. Initially, CPUs had a single core, meaning they could handle one task at a time. However, most modern CPUs are multicore, with dual-core, quad-core, and even octa-core processors being common. Each core can handle its own tasks, making multitasking smoother and more efficient. For instance, while one core handles a game you\u2019re playing, another core can manage background tasks like checking for email updates.", "title": "Key points"}, {"location": "contents/unit01/s12_cpu.html#how-the-cpu-works", "text": "To understand the CPU better, let's break down its main functions: Fetch: The CPU gets the next instruction from the device's RAM (Random Access Memory). Decode: It then decodes the instruction to understand what action is needed. Execute: The CPU performs the instruction, whether it\u2019s a calculation, data transfer, or something else. Store: Finally, the CPU writes the result back to the RAM or a register (a small storage location within the CPU).", "title": "How the CPU Works"}, {"location": "contents/unit01/s12_cpu.html#real-world-analogy", "text": "Think of the CPU like a teacher in a classroom. The teacher gives instructions to students (the device's other parts) to complete tasks. A faster teacher (higher GHz) and more teachers (more cores) mean tasks are done quicker and more efficiently. If the teacher can instruct faster, students complete their work faster. If there are multiple teachers, more students can receive instructions simultaneously, improving overall efficiency.", "title": "Real-World Analogy"}, {"location": "contents/unit01/s12_cpu.html#importance-of-cpu-in-everyday-use", "text": "In your daily use of digital devices, the CPU plays a critical role. When you launch a web browser, the CPU fetches, decodes, and executes the necessary instructions to display the web page. When you play a game, the CPU handles complex calculations to render graphics, process game logic, and respond to your inputs. Even simple tasks like typing a document or watching a video rely on the CPU to function smoothly. A powerful CPU can significantly enhance your experience by reducing lag, improving load times, and allowing for more complex applications to run seamlessly. As technology advances, CPUs continue to evolve, becoming more powerful and efficient, which in turn makes our devices more capable and responsive. Understanding the CPU's role helps you appreciate why certain devices perform better than others and why upgrading your CPU can lead to noticeable improvements in performance.", "title": "Importance of CPU in Everyday Use:"}, {"location": "contents/unit01/s12_hw_sw.html", "text": "Hardware and Software Hardware (HW): Physical Components Hardware is the part of the computer that you can touch and see.

Let\u2019s look at some of these parts and what they do! Motherboard The motherboard is like the main road where all the important parts of the computer are connected. It\u2019s a large board inside the computer that connects things like the CPU, memory, and hard drive. We also call it the \u201cmainboard\u201d or \u201clogic board.\u201d All the other parts of the computer communicate through the motherboard, which makes it very important for everything to work well together. CPU (Central Processing Unit) The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is known as the \u201cbrain\u201d of the computer. The CPU takes care of most of the thinking and calculations. When you play a game, type on the keyboard, or open a file, the CPU processes all these actions to make sure they happen correctly. It follows instructions given by the software and tells other parts of the computer what to do. Without the CPU, the computer wouldn\u2019t be able to work! ROM (Read Only Memory) ROM, or Read Only Memory, is a type of memory in the computer. The information stored in ROM cannot be changed, and it is not erased even when we turn off the computer. ROM stores important instructions that help the computer start up and check that everything is working. Since the content stays even after the power is off, ROM is very reliable for keeping essential data. RAM (Random Access Memory) RAM, or Random Access Memory, is a different type of memory. Unlike ROM, it\u2019s called read-write memory, which means the information in RAM can be changed. RAM is where the computer keeps data temporarily while you\u2019re using it, like when you\u2019re playing a game or typing a document. However, RAM is erased every time we turn off the computer, so anything stored here is only kept while the computer is on. This makes RAM very fast, and it helps the CPU work quickly with data. Hard Drives The hard drive (or hard disk) is where the computer stores all of its data, including programs, files, and photos. The hard drive keeps information even after the computer is turned off, so it is very good for storing things we want to save, like our homework or music files. Hard drives can hold a lot of information, and unlike RAM, they keep it safe even when the computer isn\u2019t powered on. How They Work Together When you use a computer, these parts all work together. For example, when you open a game, the CPU (the computer\u2019s brain) uses RAM to load the game quickly. While you play, the CPU keeps reading and writing data in the RAM because RAM is fast. If you save your game progress, the information goes from the RAM to the hard drive, where it will stay even after you turn off the computer. This way, you can continue from where you left off next time. So, the CPU, RAM, and hard drive work as a team: the CPU processes information, the RAM holds it temporarily, and the hard drive saves it for later.

We use peripheral devices to send data into the computer or receive information from it. Peripheral devices allow us to interact with the computer, making it more useful and easier to use. There are three main types of peripheral devices: input devices, output devices, and input/output devices. Input Devices An input device is something we use to send information into the computer. For example, when we type on a keyboard, we are using it to give instructions and data to the computer. Other common input devices are the mouse, which helps us move around the screen and click on things, and a scanner, which can scan pictures or documents to add them to the computer. Input devices allow us to enter information, which the computer then processes. Output Devices An output device is used to take information out of the computer so that we can see, hear, or feel it. For example, a monitor is an output device that shows images, videos, and text from the computer. Speakers are also output devices; they let us hear sounds, like music or voices, from the computer. Another example is a printer, which prints out information on paper. Output devices help us understand what the computer is doing or share the information with others. Input/Output Devices Some devices are both input and output devices. For example, a touchscreen on a smartphone or a tablet lets us touch the screen (input) and shows us information at the same time (output). These types of devices help us communicate with the computer in both directions. How Peripheral Devices Connect to the Computer Peripheral devices need to be connected to the computer to work. They connect to ports , which are special slots and openings on the computer\u2019s case. Each device has a specific type of port or connection that it needs to use. For example, a keyboard might connect to a USB port, while speakers connect to an audio port. There are two ways to connect peripheral devices to the computer: with cables or wirelessly. Cables : Many peripheral devices use cables to connect to the computer. Cables are the wires that carry data between the device and the computer. For example, a printer might use a USB cable, and a monitor might use an HDMI cable. Using cables is simple\u2014just plug the device into the port, and you\u2019re ready to go! Wireless : Some devices do not need cables; they use wireless technology to connect. This might include a wireless mouse, keyboard, or printer.

Storage devices allow us to save this data so we can access it later, even when the computer is turned off. The most common storage device in a computer is the hard drive . This drive stores the operating system (OS), which is the main program that makes the computer run. It also stores applications (like games or web browsers) and all the files and folders for the users. Types of Storage Devices There are three main types of storage devices: Magnetic, Optical, and Solid-State. Each one works differently, but all of them store data that we want to keep. Magnetic Drive or Hard Disk Drive (HDD) A Hard Disk Drive, or HDD, is a type of storage device that stores data on magnetic disks, called platters . These platters spin very fast while a tiny needle-like part, called a read/write head , moves over the surface to read or write data. Because the data is stored magnetically, it stays on the hard disk even when the computer is turned off. This is different from RAM , or memory, which is erased when we turn off the computer. HDDs are reliable and can hold a lot of data, but they can be slower than other types of drives. Optical Drive An Optical Drive uses lasers to read data from discs like CDs and DVDs. These discs have millions of tiny bumps and dips on their surface. When the laser in the optical drive shines onto the disc, it can read these bumps and dips as ones and zeros . The computer then turns these ones and zeros into information, like music, movies, or files. Optical drives are useful for reading and playing CDs or DVDs, but they are less common now because people use USB drives or online storage instead. Solid-State Drive (SSD) A Solid-State Drive, or SSD, is a storage device similar to an HDD, but it works differently. Instead of using magnetic platters, an SSD uses flash memory to store data. This flash memory keeps data even when the power is off, just like an HDD. SSDs are much faster than HDDs because they don\u2019t have moving parts; they use electronic circuits to store and access data. This speed makes SSDs a good choice for computers that need to work quickly, like gaming computers or laptops. SSDs are also more durable since they don\u2019t have moving parts that can break. Additional Solid-State Storage: Pen Drive A pen drive , also called a USB flash drive, is another type of solid-state storage. It\u2019s a small, portable device that uses flash memory, just like an SSD. A pen drive has a built-in USB connection, which makes it easy to plug into a computer and save or transfer files. Pen drives are great for moving files between computers or backing up important data. Each of these storage devices\u2014HDDs, optical drives, SSDs, and pen drives\u2014offers different ways to store data safely.

HDDs are reliable and can hold a lot of data, but they can be slower than other types of drives. Optical Drive An Optical Drive uses lasers to read data from discs like CDs and DVDs. These discs have millions of tiny bumps and dips on their surface. When the laser in the optical drive shines onto the disc, it can read these bumps and dips as ones and zeros . The computer then turns these ones and zeros into information, like music, movies, or files. Optical drives are useful for reading and playing CDs or DVDs, but they are less common now because people use USB drives or online storage instead. Solid-State Drive (SSD) A Solid-State Drive, or SSD, is a storage device similar to an HDD, but it works differently. Instead of using magnetic platters, an SSD uses flash memory to store data. This flash memory keeps data even when the power is off, just like an HDD. SSDs are much faster than HDDs because they don\u2019t have moving parts; they use electronic circuits to store and access data. This speed makes SSDs a good choice for computers that need to work quickly, like gaming computers or laptops. SSDs are also more durable since they don\u2019t have moving parts that can break. Additional Solid-State Storage: Pen Drive A pen drive , also called a USB flash drive, is another type of solid-state storage. It\u2019s a small, portable device that uses flash memory, just like an SSD. A pen drive has a built-in USB connection, which makes it easy to plug into a computer and save or transfer files. Pen drives are great for moving files between computers or backing up important data. Each of these storage devices\u2014HDDs, optical drives, SSDs, and pen drives\u2014offers different ways to store data safely. They let us keep our files, photos, and programs accessible and secure, making our computers more useful in everyday life.", "title": "Storage Devices"}, {"location": "contents/unit01/s13_apps.html", "text": "Applications Applications, or apps , are programs that let us do specific tasks on a computer, smartphone, or tablet.

Client-Server Model The client-server model is a popular framework for computer networking, where devices are divided into clients and servers , each with specific roles and responsibilities. This model is widely used on the internet and in Local Area Networks (LANs) . Client Devices : Clients are devices, often personal computers or mobile devices, with network software that allows them to send requests and receive information over the network. Server Devices : Servers are devices designed to store data, host databases, and manage complex applications like websites. They often have high-powered processors, large amounts of memory, and extensive storage capacity to handle requests from multiple clients simultaneously. Client-Server Applications In client-server applications, network clients send messages to servers to request specific information or services. Servers then process these requests and return the relevant information or perform specific actions.

Your web browser uses the internet to retrieve and display these pages. History of the World Wide Web The World Wide Web was invented in 1989 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee as a tool to help scientists easily share and access experiment data. At that time, both hypertext and the internet existed, but there was no way to link one document to another across the internet. The web enabled this linking through a combination of hypertext and internet technologies, opening up the internet to the general public and allowing people to connect, share, and communicate in unprecedented ways. Today, people use the web to share content through social networks, blogs, and video platforms. Key Components of the Web HyperText Markup Language (HTML) HTML is the standard markup language used to create webpages. It allows for formatting documents, embedding multimedia, and linking to other resources. While web browsers don\u2019t display HTML code itself, they use it to render the content of each page. Uniform Resource Locator (URL) A URL is the unique \"address\" for each resource on the web. It identifies the location of files, webpages, and other resources, enabling browsers to open websites and download files like images, videos, or software hosted on servers. Web Server A web server is a program that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to serve files that make up a website to users, responding to requests from browsers. Common web server software includes Apache and Microsoft IIS . HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) HTTP is the protocol used to transfer data across the web. It operates in a client-server model, where the client (like a computer or mobile device) sends requests, and the server responds by delivering the requested webpage or resource. Secure Websites: HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) HTTPS is an extension of HTTP, designed to provide secure data transmission through an SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) encryption. Websites that handle sensitive information, like banking or e-commerce sites, use HTTPS. A web address starting with https:// indicates a secure connection, often accompanied by a lock icon in the browser. Web Browsers A web browser , or simply \"browser,\" is a software application used to access and view websites. Popular browsers include Microsoft Edge , Google Chrome , Mozilla Firefox , Opera , and Apple Safari . Browsers interpret HTML and other web technologies to render content, which includes text, images, and multimedia elements on the webpage. Search Engines Search engines are tools that index and categorize millions of websites, allowing users to search for information using keywords. They scan documents and files on the web and return results based on relevance to the search terms. Well-known search engines include Google , Bing , and Yahoo . These components work together to enable the functionality of the World Wide Web and make accessing, sharing, and creating information online straightforward and convenient.", "title": "The World Wide Web"}, {"location": "contents/unit02/s21_www.html#world-wide-web-www", "text": "", "title": "World Wide Web (WWW)"}, {"location": "contents/unit02/s21_www.html#world-wide-web-vs-internet", "text": "Many people think that the Internet and the World Wide Web are the same, but they are distinct systems that work closely together: The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and devices, using various protocols to communicate and share data.

Well first of all, the World Wide Web is not the Internet, even though the terms are often used interchangeably. The Internet is simply the way computers connect to each other in order to share information. When the Internet first emerged, computers actually made direct calls to each other. Today, networks are all around us, so computers can communicate seamlessly. The communication enabled through the Internet has many uses, such as email, file transfer, and conferencing. But the most common use is accessing the World Wide Web. Think of the Web as a bunch of skyscrapers, each representing a web server, a computer always connected to the Internet, specifically designed to store information and share it. When someone starts a website, they are renting a room in this skyscraper, filling it with information and linking that information together in an organized way for others to access. The people who own these skyscrapers and rent space in them are called web hosts, but anyone can set up a web server with the right equipment and a bit of know-how. There's another part to having a website, without which we would be lost in the city with no way of finding what we need. This is the website address, which consists of domain names. Just like with a real-life address, a website address lets you get where you want to go. The information stored in the websites is in web languages, such as HTML and JavaScript. When we find the website we're looking for, our web browser is able to take all the code on the site and turn it into words, graphics, and videos. We don't need to know any special computer languages because the web browser creates a graphic interface for us. So, in a lot of ways, the World Wide Web is a big virtual city where we communicate with each other in web languages, with browsers acting as our translators. And just like no one owns a city, no one owns the Web; it belongs to all of us. Anyone can move in and set up shop. We might have to pay an Internet service provider to gain access, a hosting company to rent web space, or a registrar to reserve our web address. Like utility companies in a city, these companies provide crucial services, but in the end, not even they own the Web. But what really makes the Web so special lies in its very name. Prior to the Web, we used to consume most information in a linear fashion. In a book or newspaper article, each sentence was read from beginning to end, page by page, in a straight line until you reached the end. But that isn't how our brains actually work. Each of our thoughts is linked to other thoughts, memories, and emotions in a loose interconnected network, like a web. Tim Berners-Lee, the father of the World Wide Web, understood that we needed a way to organize information that mirrored this natural arrangement. And the Web accomplishes this through hyperlinks. By linking several pages within a website or even redirecting you to other websites to expand on information or ideas immediately as you encounter them, hyperlinks allow the Web to operate along the same lines as our thought patterns.

The Digital Divide The digital divide is a term that describes the gap between people who have easy access to digital technology, like computers and the internet, and those who do not. This divide can be seen in many different ways, such as differences in access to high-speed internet, the availability of digital devices like laptops and smartphones, and the skills needed to use these technologies effectively. Imagine you have a classroom where half of the students have their own laptops and can easily go online to do research, complete homework, and communicate with their teachers. The other half, however, do not have computers at home and have to rely on the limited time they get on school computers. This creates a significant difference in how well they can learn and complete their work. This situation illustrates the digital divide. Reasons for the Digital Divide Economic Factors : One of the biggest reasons for the digital divide is money. Digital devices and internet services can be expensive. Families with higher incomes can afford to buy the latest technology and pay for fast internet connections, while families with lower incomes may struggle to afford even a basic computer or internet service. Geographical Factors : Where people live also affects their access to digital technology. In many rural areas, high-speed internet may not be available at all, or it might be much slower and more expensive than in cities. This can make it hard for people in these areas to use the internet for things like schoolwork, job searches, and accessing important information. Educational Factors : Some people may not know how to use digital technology effectively, even if they have access to it. Schools that lack resources may not be able to teach students the digital skills they need. Additionally, adults who did not grow up with technology might find it challenging to learn how to use new devices and software. Impact of the Digital Divide The digital divide can have several important effects on people's lives: Education : Students without access to digital technology may fall behind in their studies because they cannot do online research, complete digital assignments, or participate in online classes. This can affect their grades and future opportunities. Employment : Many jobs today require digital skills, such as using a computer or navigating the internet. People without these skills or without access to technology may find it harder to get good jobs. They might miss out on job opportunities or be unable to complete job applications, which are often online. Access to Information : The internet is a major source of information on everything from news to health advice. People without access to the internet may not be able to get the information they need quickly and easily. This can affect their ability to stay informed and make good decisions. Bridging the Digital Divide Many efforts are being made to close the digital divide. Schools and libraries often provide free internet access and computer use. Some organizations donate computers to families in need or offer affordable internet services. Teaching digital skills in schools is also crucial to ensure that everyone, regardless of their background, can use technology effectively. Understanding and addressing the digital divide is essential to ensure that everyone has equal opportunities to learn, work, and participate fully in today's digital world.
