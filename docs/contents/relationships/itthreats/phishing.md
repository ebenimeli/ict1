## Phishing

**What it is**

Fake emails, text messages and websites created to look like they're from authentic companies. They're sent by criminals to steal personal and financial information from you. This is also known as “spoofing”.

**What it does**

- Trick you into giving them information by asking you to update, validate or confirm your account. It is often presented in a manner than seems official and intimidating
- Provides cyber criminals with your username and passwords so that they can access your accounts (online bank account, shopping accounts, etc.) and steal your credit card numbers.
