## Hacking

**What it is**

The process by which cyber criminals gain unauthorized access to a computer. The availability of information online on the tools, techniques, and malware makes it easier for even non-technical people to undertake malicious activities.

**What it can do**

- Find weaknesses (or pre-existing bugs) in your security settings and exploit them in order to access your information.
- Install a Trojan horse, providing a back door for hackers to enter and search for your information.
