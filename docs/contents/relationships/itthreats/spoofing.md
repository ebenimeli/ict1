## Spoofing

**What it is**

A website or email address that is created to look like it comes from a legitimate source. An email address may even include your own name, or the name of someone you know, making it difficult to discern whether or not the sender is real.

**What it does**

- Spends spam using your email address, or a variation of your email address, to your contact list.
- Recreates websites that closely resemble the authentic site. This could be a financial institution or other site that requires login or other personal information.
