## Worms

**What they are**

A worm, unlike a virus, goes to work on its own without attaching itself to files or programs. It lives in your computer memory, doesn't damage or alter the hard drive and propagates by sending itself to other computers in a network â€“ whether within a company or the Internet itself.

**What they can do**

- Spread to everyone in your contact list.
- Cause a tremendous amount of damage by shutting down parts of the Internet, wreaking havoc on an internal network and costing companies enormous amounts of lost revenue.
