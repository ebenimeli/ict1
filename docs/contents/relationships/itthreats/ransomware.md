## Ransomware

**What it is**

Ransomware is a type of malware that restricts access to your computer or your files and displays a message that demands payment in order for the restriction to be removed.

There are two common types of ransomware:
- Lockscreen ransomware: displays an image that prevents you from accessing your computer
- Encryption ransomware: encrypts files on your systemâ€™s drives, and even some cloud storage drives, preventing you from opening them.
