Welcome to the Google Online Safety Roadshow. We're here to teach you a few things you need to know so you can stay safe online and enjoy all of the fun things that the web has to offer.

Protect your stuff! Most of us have things on the web that we want to keep safe. One of the best ways to keep those things safe is to make sure that you set strong passwords on all your accounts. By knowing how to create strong passwords, you can further safeguard your personal information. 

So how do you create a really strong password? First, use at least eight characters. The longer your password is, the harder it is to guess. Second, mix letters, numbers, and symbols. And third, make it different for each site. Once we know how to set a strong password, we need to learn how to remember that strong password.

At Google, we recommend you pick a favorite book title, sports team, song, or phrase to help you build a strong password. Don't share your password unless it's with a parent or trusted adult. Like the key to your house or the combination to your locker, passwords protect things that are of value to you and shouldn't be shared.

Protecting your information online also means logging out of websites, programs, and applications that are used on public or shared computers when you're done with them. If you don't log out of public computers, someone could log in as you and access your accounts and information.

So always remember to protect your stuff.
