Welcome to the Google Online Safety Roadshow. We're here to teach you a few things you need to know so you can stay safe online and enjoy all of the fun things that the web has to offer.

Avoid scams! Everyone knows you never take candy from a stranger, right? The same principle applies online. If someone offers you candy... [woman screams] Some new shoes... [woman retches] A tablet... Or told you you won a trip to Hawaii... You should be suspicious. This might seem harmless, but these could be very dangerous ways to lure you in and steal your passwords or even your identity.

This is known as phishing. Phishing is the act of attempting to acquire information such as usernames, passwords, and personal details by pretending to be a trustworthy source. By knowing how to identify a phishing scam, you can protect yourself and your things. When in doubt, ask a parent, teacher, or trusted adult.

So be aware, and avoid scams.
