Welcome to the Google Online Safety Roadshow. We're here to teach you a few things you need to know so you can stay safe online and enjoy all of the fun things that the web has to offer.

Know and use your settings! Why do you need to understand settings? Because not all information people post online is meant to be seen by absolutely everyone. Some information should be kept private or shared with a smaller audience, just like in the real world, where you share different things with different people.

You can share some pictures with family and friends, but think carefully about what you share with everyone else. Security settings can help you control who can see your posts, making it easier for you to keep your information safe. Most sites will have settings buttons where you can easily find them, though remember, they can be in different places on each site you use.

The wrong settings can expose your personal details to more people than you intended. So always remember-- to know and use your settings.
