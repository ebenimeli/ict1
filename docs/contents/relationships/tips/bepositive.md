Welcome to the Google Online Safety Roadshow. We're here to teach you a few things you need to know so you can stay safe online and enjoy all of the fun things that the web has to offer.

Be positive. Everyone, including students, is responsible for creating a great online experience. There are lots of ways, big and small, to help make this happen today. Try to do something positive on the web each day. Leave an encouraging comment or send someone a thank you text. These kinds of gestures are easy, quick, and can really make a lasting impact on someone's day.

You'll feel great and inspire other people to be kind online too. A little positivity can go a long way and have a huge ripple effect online. The opposite is also true. A little negativity can spread into something big and ugly online. If you see someone being mean, talk to an adult, or take charge and report it yourself. Only by acting can you make change happen for you and the people around you, online and in the real world.

Everyone can be a leader and set a good example on the internet for others. There are so many opportunities to do amazing things online. You can use the web to explore your world around you, answer important questions, and solve big problems. The only question is-- how are you going to change the world? So set a good example and be positive.
