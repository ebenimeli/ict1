## Effects on the Environment

Digital devices help us in many ways, but they also affect the environment:

- **Energy Use**: Devices need electricity to work. When many people use electricity, we need more energy from power plants, which can produce pollution. To save energy, turn off your device when you are not using it, or put it on "sleep mode."

- **E-Waste**: Old or broken devices, like phones and computers, become electronic waste, or “e-waste.” E-waste can be dangerous if it ends up in landfills because it contains harmful chemicals that can pollute the ground and water.

- **Resource Use**: Making digital devices requires natural resources, like metals and minerals. Mining these resources uses energy and can damage the environment. By keeping our devices for as long as possible, we can help reduce the need for new resources.

## Digital Devices and Sustainability

We can make choices to help protect the environment. Here are some ways to be sustainable with digital devices:

- **Recycle**: When a device no longer works, recycle it. Many places have special recycling programs for electronics, so they do not end up in landfills. Recycling old devices helps recover metals and other materials.

- **Repair Instead of Replace**: If a device breaks, try to fix it instead of buying a new one. Repairing devices saves money and reduces e-waste.

- **Share Devices**: If you have more than one device, share it with family members or friends. This helps reduce the need to buy new devices and saves resources.

- **Be Mindful of Energy Use**: Turn off your device if you are not using it, and unplug chargers when they are not in use. This saves energy and helps reduce pollution.
