# Basic Security Habits to Protect Devices

Learning to keep our devices secure is important. Devices like tablets, smartphones, and computers help us with school, communicate with friends, and play games. But if we are not careful, our devices can be at risk. Hackers, viruses, and other dangers can make our devices stop working or can steal our information. Here are some basic security habits to protect our devices.

## 1. Connect to the Internet Safely

When we use the internet, we need to be careful about how we connect. Public Wi-Fi networks, like those in malls or cafes, are not always safe. If possible, avoid using public Wi-Fi for things like online shopping or entering passwords. Instead, use your home Wi-Fi or a trusted connection. This helps to keep your personal information safe.

If you must use public Wi-Fi, remember not to share private information like your full name, address, or phone number. Hackers can watch what you do on public Wi-Fi and may try to steal this information.

## 2. Create Strong Passwords

A strong password is like a lock that keeps others out of your device or accounts. A good password should have a mix of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and special characters like "!" or "@". Avoid using easy words, like "password" or "1234," because hackers can guess these quickly. 

Also, try not to use the same password for everything. If one account gets hacked, then all your accounts are at risk. Change your passwords regularly, too—maybe once every three months. 

A safe password could look like this: `S0ccer@Best!`. It has numbers, symbols, and a mix of letters, making it harder to guess.

## 3. Be Careful with Links and Attachments

Sometimes we receive messages or emails with links or attachments. Not all links or attachments are safe. Some may come from strangers pretending to be someone you know. This is called phishing. If you click on these links or open these files, your device can get a virus or a hacker can steal your information.

If you receive a message from someone you don’t know, don’t click on any links or open any attachments. Also, be careful with links in emails or messages, even if they look like they’re from a company you know. Check with an adult if you’re unsure.

## 4. Install Updates Regularly

Your devices and apps need updates to stay secure. Updates fix problems and add new features. They also help protect against new types of malware and viruses. If you ignore updates, your device may be at risk. 

When you see an update notification on your device, don’t ignore it. Set a time to install it soon. You can ask an adult for help if you’re not sure how to update.

## 5. Use Antivirus Software

Antivirus software helps protect your device from malware and viruses. It works like a guard, scanning for dangers and warning you about unsafe files. Make sure your antivirus software is up to date, and run a scan regularly. Many devices come with antivirus software installed, but if yours doesn’t, ask an adult for help installing one.

## 6. Log Out After Using Accounts

When you finish using an online account, like email or a game account, remember to log out. Logging out is like closing the door after leaving a room; it helps keep others from using your account without permission. This is especially important on shared or public devices. 

## 7. Recognize the Effects of Technology on Health and the Environment

Taking care of our devices and using them safely also means thinking about our health and the environment. Spending too much time on screens can cause eye strain, headaches, and make it hard to sleep. Try to take breaks and look away from your screen every 20 minutes.

Using devices also affects the environment. Devices need energy to work, and making them uses natural resources. When you are not using your devices, turn them off or put them to sleep to save energy. 

## 8. Think Before Downloading Apps

Not all apps are safe. Some apps have viruses or can steal information from your device. Before downloading any app, check if it’s from a trusted source, like the official app store. Read the reviews and ask an adult if it’s okay to download it.

## 9. Avoid Sharing Personal Information

Personal information, like your name, address, or school, should not be shared online. Sharing too much can make you vulnerable to hackers or people with bad intentions. Keep personal details private, and if a website or app asks for this information, think twice before giving it.

## 10. Ask for Help

If something doesn’t seem right, or if you have questions about staying safe, ask a parent, teacher, or other trusted adult. Learning about digital security can feel complicated, but you’re not alone. It’s always better to ask for help than to take a risk.

By following these basic security habits, we can help protect our devices and personal information. Staying safe online is important for our own security, health, and even for protecting the environment.
