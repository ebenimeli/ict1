# Implications of Using Digital Devices for Health, Sustainability, and the Environment

We use digital devices like phones, computers, and tablets every day. They help us learn, communicate, and have fun. But using these devices also has an impact on our health, the environment, and the world. Understanding these effects can help us make smarter, safer choices.

By understanding the effects of using digital devices on our health, the environment, and the problem of obsolescence, we can make better choices. We can protect our health by limiting screen time and using the 20-20-20 rule. We can be kind to the environment by recycling old devices, reducing energy use, and repairing instead of replacing. Finally, by connecting safely to the internet and using basic security habits, we can keep our devices safe and lasting longer.
