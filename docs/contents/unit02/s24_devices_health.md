# Digital Devices and Health

<img src="images/backpain_eyestrain.jpeg" class="header" >

## Introduction

**Digital device use** can lead to eye strain, headaches, and back pain due to poor posture and prolonged screen exposure. To prevent discomfort, adjust screen height, reduce glare, and take regular breaks. Blinking often helps avoid dry eyes.

Headaches are common due to close screen proximity and can be alleviated by stretching and maintaining good posture. Back pain can be reduced by practicing dynamic sitting, adjusting backrests, and using lumbar support.

**Ergonomics** plays a crucial role in optimizing equipment design to enhance comfort and efficiency, reducing strain and promoting overall health in work and living spaces.

### How digital devices affect our bodies

<img src="images/backpain_sit.jpg" >

Using digital devices affects our bodies. Here are some common effects:

- **Eye Strain**: When we look at screens for a long time, our eyes can become tired. This is called "eye strain." It can make our eyes hurt, feel dry, or blurry. To avoid this, remember the "20-20-20 rule": every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.

- **Sleep Problems**: The light from screens (especially at night) can make it hard for us to sleep. Our brains need darkness to know when it’s time to rest. Avoid using screens at least one hour before bed to help your brain relax.

- **Bad Posture**: When we use devices for too long, we may hunch over, which is bad for our neck and back. Try to sit up straight and take breaks to move around.

- **Less Physical Activity**: Spending too much time on screens means less time being active, which is important for staying healthy. Balance screen time with physical activities, like playing outside or doing sports.

Digital devices cause eye strain, sleep issues, poor posture, and less physical activity. Take breaks, limit screen use, and stay active.

## Risks and Tips

### Eyestrain

Computer users may experience symptoms such as blurred vision, temporary inability to focus on faraway objects and headaches.

- Computer screen - Adjust the height of your screen so you're not tilting your head down and tensing your neck.
- Lighting - Try adjusting the screen and the lights to keep glare to a minimum.
- Rest breaks - Taking periodic breaks, during which you relax and gently stretch your neck muscles, can ease muscle strain. 
- Remembering to blink can help you avoid dry eyes

<div class="note">
Adjust screen height, reduce glare, take breaks, and blink regularly to <b>prevent eye strain</b>, headaches, and muscle tension for computer users.
</div>

### Headache

A computer screen is much like a television but you sit much closer to it. The light coming from the monitor can cause eyestrain if you stare at it for too long. This and also other reasons when working at a computer, including stress and poor posture can lead to a headache.

Regular breaks can help reduce muscle strain and alleviate these problems.

<div class="note">
Sitting close to screens causes eyestrain and headaches; poor posture adds to the issue. Regular breaks reduce muscle strain and discomfort.
</div>

### Backpain

While working at the computer, back pain is one of the most common workplace problems.

- Practice «dynamic sitting»: be flexible and move while sit, don’t just stay in one static posture.
- Adjust the backrest so you are sitting at a 90 degree angle.
- Adjust the lumbar support to fit your low back's natural inward curve.
- Adjust the height of the backrest to support the natural inward curvature of the lower back. Use your armrests.

<div class="note">
To <b>prevent back pain</b> while working, practice dynamic sitting, adjust backrests and lumbar support, and use armrests for comfort.

## Ergonomics

### What is ergonomics?

Ergonomics is the scientific study focused on optimizing the design of equipment, tools, and workspaces to enhance efficiency, comfort, and safety.

It involves understanding human anatomy, behavior, and limitations to create environments and products that align with the body's natural movements and capabilities.

<div class="note">
The scientific study of equipment design, as in office furniture or transportation seating, for the purpose of improving efficiency, comfort, or safety.
</div>

For instance, in office settings, ergonomic principles guide the design of chairs, desks, and computer setups to reduce strain on the neck, back, and wrists, thereby preventing repetitive stress injuries and promoting good posture. Similarly, in transportation, ergonomic seating aims to provide both comfort and safety, reducing fatigue during long journeys.

By considering factors like body posture, movement, and the reduction of physical strain, ergonomics not only improves productivity but also enhances overall well-being.

This field draws on knowledge from disciplines such as biomechanics, psychology, and engineering to create user-friendly solutions that cater to the needs of diverse populations, ultimately contributing to healthier and more sustainable work and living environments.
