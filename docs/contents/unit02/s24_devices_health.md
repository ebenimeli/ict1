# Digital Devices and Health

Using digital devices affects our bodies. Here are some common effects:

- **Eye Strain**: When we look at screens for a long time, our eyes can become tired. This is called "eye strain." It can make our eyes hurt, feel dry, or blurry. To avoid this, remember the "20-20-20 rule": every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.

- **Sleep Problems**: The light from screens (especially at night) can make it hard for us to sleep. Our brains need darkness to know when itâ€™s time to rest. Avoid using screens at least one hour before bed to help your brain relax.

- **Bad Posture**: When we use devices for too long, we may hunch over, which is bad for our neck and back. Try to sit up straight and take breaks to move around.

- **Less Physical Activity**: Spending too much time on screens means less time being active, which is important for staying healthy. Balance screen time with physical activities, like playing outside or doing sports.
