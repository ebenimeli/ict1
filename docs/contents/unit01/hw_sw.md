# Hardware and Software

**Hardware (HW): Physical Components**  
Hardware is the part of the computer that you can touch and see. It includes all the physical parts that make a computer work. For example, the screen you look at, the keyboard you type on, and the mouse you use to move around are all pieces of hardware. Inside the computer, there are also important hardware parts, like the memory (RAM) that stores information, and the hard drive that saves files and programs. Hardware is like the body of the computer. Without it, a computer couldn’t work at all!

**Software (SW): Logical Components**  
Software is the part of the computer that you cannot touch. It’s the programs, or instructions, that tell the hardware what to do. For example, when you open a game, the game software is what makes the characters move, make sounds, and score points. There are many types of software: some help us write documents, others help us do math, and some allow us to connect to the Internet. The operating system (like Windows or MacOS) is also software; it helps the computer manage everything so that all programs work together. Software is like the mind of the computer, telling the hardware how to work. 

Together, hardware and software allow computers to do useful tasks, from sending messages to solving problems and having fun!
