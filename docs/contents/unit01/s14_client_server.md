# Client-Server Model

## IP Address

An **IP address** is a unique string of numbers, typically separated by dots (IPv4) or colons (IPv6), that identifies each device using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network. IP addresses enable devices to locate and connect with each other on local networks or the internet.

## Client-Server Model

The **client-server model** is a popular framework for computer networking, where devices are divided into **clients** and **servers**, each with specific roles and responsibilities. This model is widely used on the internet and in **Local Area Networks (LANs)**.

- **Client Devices**: Clients are devices, often personal computers or mobile devices, with network software that allows them to send requests and receive information over the network.
- **Server Devices**: Servers are devices designed to store data, host databases, and manage complex applications like websites. They often have high-powered processors, large amounts of memory, and extensive storage capacity to handle requests from multiple clients simultaneously.

## Client-Server Applications

In client-server applications, **network clients** send messages to servers to request specific information or services. **Servers** then process these requests and return the relevant information or perform specific actions. This model supports various popular internet applications, such as email, file sharing, and web browsing, where a single server can serve multiple clients.

## Internet Services

The internet provides a variety of essential services, including:

1. **World Wide Web (WWW)**: A system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via web browsers.
2. **Email**: Allows users to send and receive messages over the internet.
3. **Videoconferencing (VC)**: Facilitates real-time video and audio communication between users at different locations.
4. **Instant Messaging (IM)**: Enables real-time text-based communication between users.
5. **Social Networks**: Platforms where users can connect, share content, and communicate.
6. **File Synchronization**: Allows users to keep files consistent across multiple devices.
7. **Search Engines**: Tools for finding information on the internet.
8. **Online Encyclopedias**: Resources for free, community-sourced information (e.g., Wikipedia).
9. **Cloud Storage and File Sharing**: Services like Google Drive and Dropbox, allowing users to store and share files remotely. 

These services represent only a few examples of how the client-server model enables modern internet functionality.
